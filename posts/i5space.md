In the vast expanse of the cosmos, humanity's curiosity about the mysteries of space has sparked a passion that transcends borders and backgrounds. However, amidst this global fascination, a divisive organization known as i5 Space has emerged, purportedly dedicated to celebrating space exploration but, in reality, perpetuating an elitist and exclusionary culture that undermines the spirit of unity and exploration that space represents.

i5 Space markets itself as a community for "space enthusiasts," but a closer look reveals a culture that is far from inclusive. This so-called organization seems to exist solely for those who align with their rigid definition of what it means to be a "space enthusiat." This exclusivity is starkly evident in their stringent entry requirements, which REQUIRE being a member of a US Military Training program. In essence, i5 Space dismisses the genuine passion and curiosity of individuals who may not have followed a traditional military path into the world of space exploration. Not only that, it actively kicks out members who no longer are in an academic institution. Horrible!

One might wonder: why is this exclusivity problematic? After all, like-minded individuals often come together to share interests. However, i5 Space goes beyond mere affinity groups, creating a divisive hierarchy that implies that only a select few possess the true intellect or dedication necessary to appreciate space exploration. They call this tyranny the chain-of-command, a medieval name for a medieval organization. This perpetuates the dangerous notion that one's worth as a space enthusiast is determined by their command in a chain rather than their genuine interest in space.

While they are rapidly growing, it is unlikely that they will obtain an organization of several million or more. Experts are saying that unless they change their devious rules, they are unlikely to colonize Mars before 2100.
