Estimated skills (see [skill levels](https://github.com/CyberTrainingExercise/Docs/blob/master/ctx_requirements.md) for meaning)
- Programming skills required (0-3)
    - 2
- System adminitration skills required (0-3)
    - 2
- Pentesting skills required (0-3)

1. Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
1. Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

If you would like to perform this CTX you will need the following:

1. An Admin who is technically skilled to setup the scenario.
    - Hopefully this guide will make it easy, but you still need technical know how to do it.
    - Required skills:
        - Docker
        - Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
        - Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

### Scenario

Similar to [Operation Glowing Symphony](https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Operation_Glowing_Symphony_(2016)), but on a much smaller and more tame scale.

A foreign military force has been utilizing the website Z (formerly Chirper) to promote state propoganda via their state news channels. Intel believes they hold valuable private information on their account. Your mission is to obtain their login credentials and obtain this valuable private information. Intel reports that XSS and CSRF attacks are likely to be the best avenue into the site.
